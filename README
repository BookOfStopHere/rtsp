RTSP Server

This is part of my hands-on work for my course at The George Washington 
University. A simplified RTSP server is designed and implemented with 
Object-Oriented paradigm. It is designed to work as a embedded service 
in a client software of media streaming system. The implementation is 
only a framework that responds RTSP messages. Actual media loading and 
streaming is not included.
